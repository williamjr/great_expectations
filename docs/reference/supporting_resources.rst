Supporting Resources
=====================

Great Expectations requires a python compute environment and access to data, either locally or
through a database or distributed cluster. In addition, developing with great expectations relies
heavily on tools in the Python engineering ecosystem: pip, virtual environments, and jupyter notebooks.
We also assume some level of familiarity with git and version control.

See the links below for good, practical tutorials for these tools.
